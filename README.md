## üíª What I learned:
  
- JavaScript Concepts:

    Event handling: Utilizing addEventListener to capture user keyboard input for moving the user block.
    DOM manipulation: Creating, styling, and positioning elements dynamically within the game grid using JavaScript.
    Animation: Implementing animation by updating element positions at intervals using setInterval.
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implementing a Block class to create block instances and manage their positions.

- Game Logic:

    Basic collision detection: Understanding the concept of ball movement and collision with the window edges (gridWidth).
    Incorporating movement: Managing the movement of the ball (moveBall()) by changing its coordinates based on direction variables.
    Handling boundaries: Limiting the user's movement within the game window and ensuring the ball bounces off the edges.

- Project Organization:

    Structuring the code into logical components such as functions for user movement, ball movement, drawing elements, and block generation.
    Separating concerns: Dividing the code into distinct functions for readability and maintainability.

- Debugging Skills:

    Identifying and resolving issues related to movement, positioning, or element interaction.
    Experimenting and tweaking variables or logic to achieve the desired behavior of the game.

- Game Development Concepts:

    Understanding the fundamental principles of game design, including user interaction, object movement, and collision detection.
